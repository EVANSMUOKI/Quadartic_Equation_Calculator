The Smart Contract code is in the src lib.re. The Smart Contract involves a quadratic_equation_calculator which takes input from the user. The input is the coefficients for three terms of a quadratic equation. The Smart Contract the prorgram uses the quadratic formula to return the roots of the equation as the output. The result may be of three types, perfect, real or imaginary depending with the coefficients entred vy the user. Once executed, it is reset to zero and prompts the user to input another set of coefficients for executions.
